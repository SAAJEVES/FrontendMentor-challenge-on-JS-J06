## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid


### What I learned
I learnt how to customize range and also toggle. Concerning the customise toggle, I came to see the importance of the `label` tag element. And this is my first time of using the `switch` statement and `grid` display in a project.



### Continued development

Continued development in `HTML, CSS and JavaScript`.

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.
